# simple-django-contact-form
### Simple Django contact form to integrate in any Django web app.

The ContactForm app has been encapsulated so that it can be easily integrated with your Django App.

The configuration used in this example is for Gmail server. If you are using other mail server, change the corresponding `EMAIL_HOST` and `EMAIL_PORT`.

Also, if you are using a Gmail account for sending the contact message, please read [this StackOverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26697565/django-smtpauthenticationerror) about how to allow the access for "less secure apps"
